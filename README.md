# Spellcore

**Spellcore** is a work in progress towards a modular API-Agonistic and extensible renderer for real-time rendering. Scoped for personal research, it is currently being built from the ground up using OpenGL as a base, but with a proper RHI (Rendering Hardware Interaface) abstraction layer to focus on flexibility, shader experimentation, and modern graphics pipeline control.

## Key Goals for Spellcore

- 🎯 **Shader-Centric Design**: At the core of Spellcore is a custom `SpellcoreShader` system that will enable shader abstraction.
- 🧱 **Component-Based Render Architecture**: Separation of scene logic and render data through structured pools and registries.
- 🧠 **ECS-Friendly Integration**: Designed to integrate cleanly with external ECS systems like `entt`.
- 🎮 **Real-Time Rendering**: Suitable for interactive applications, visualization, and experimentation.
- 🧪 **Research & Prototyping**: Acts as a rendering testbed for exploring advanced features like clipping planes, render queues, and per-object data pools.
- 🚀 **Minimal External Dependencies**: Uses only essential libraries for OpenGL context, math, and asset loading.
